## Data Science And Buisness Analytics Internship
## Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
  In this tasks focuses on Prediction of scores achieved by students using Linear Regression(Supervised ML). Our main problem is to Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. So for this task, I have applied Linear Regression for predicting student's percentage based on the number of study hours.

## Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
   This task is to predict of the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually, from the given ‘Iris’ dataset. So for this task, I am using K Means Clustering (Unsupervised ML).
